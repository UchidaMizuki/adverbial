# partialised

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/partialised)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=partialised)
<!-- badges: end -->

partialised extends purrr's partialised functions to allow easy modification of 
arguments. These are similar to function-like objects in Julia 
(https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Function-like-objects).

## Installation

You can install the development version of partialised from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("partialised")

# the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UchidaMizuki/partialised")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(partialised)

dist <- function(x, y) {
  sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
}

pdist <- new_partialised(dist,
                         list(x = 3))
pdist
pdist(y = 4)

arguments(pdist)
pdist$x
pdist$y

pdist$x <- 6
pdist(y = 8)

pdist$y <- 8
pdist()
```
