# adverbial (former partialised)

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/adverbial)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=adverbial)
<!-- badges: end -->

adverbial provides `new_partialised()` and `new_composed()`, which extend the 
`partial()` and `compose()` functions of 'purrr' to make it easier to extract and 
replace arguments and functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of adverbial from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("adverbial")

# the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UchidaMizuki/adverbial")
```

## Example

### Partialised functions

```{r example-partialised}
library(adverbial)

dist <- function(x, y) {
  sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
}

pdist <- new_partialised(
  dist,
  list(x = 3)
)
pdist
pdist(y = 4)

pdist[]
pdist$x
pdist$y

pdist$x <- 6
pdist(y = 8)

pdist$y <- 8
pdist()
```

### Composed functions

```{r example-composed}
square <- function(x) x^2
cdist <- new_composed(
  list(
    square = square,
    sum = sum,
    sqrt = sqrt
  ),
  dir = "forward"
)
cdist
cdist(1:10)

cdist[]
cdist$sum <- new_partialised(sum, list(na.rm = TRUE))
cdist(c(1:10, NA))
```
