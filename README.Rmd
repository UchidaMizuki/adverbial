You can install the development version of partialised from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UchidaMizuki/partialised")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(partialised)

dist <- function(x, y) {
  sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
}

pdist <- new_partialised(dist,
                         list(x = 3))

pdist
pdist(y = 4)

arguments(pdist)
arguments(pdist)$x <- 6

pdist
pdist(y = 8)

arg(pdist, "y")
arg(pdist, "y") <- 8

pdist
pdist()
```
