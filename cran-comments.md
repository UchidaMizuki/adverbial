The package name has been changed from 'partialised' to 'adverbial', as the addition of features makes the name clearly inappropriate for the functionality provided by the package name.
'adverbial' is due to the fact that it extends adverbs such as partial() and compose() of 'purrr'.
We hope you understand.
There are no inverse dependencies and problems are expected to be minimal.
